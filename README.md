# useMovie App

This is an app where users can find the movie lists and view the details of the movie by clicking on any of them. Also, the user can give personalized star ratings to the movies that the user has already seen. After that users can add that movie to their watched-list for reviewing it later.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Vite with react
- Functional Component
- States and Props
- useState
- Props Drilling
- Controlled components
- Fetching
- Async and Await
- Error handling
- useEffect
- useEffect Cleanup function
- Local Storage
- useRef

### What I learned

Here, I learned more about fetching data from the outside world using useEffect and applying async and await functionality to achieve asynchronous programming. I used the concept of prop drilling here, which we can use to pass the variables of one component to its sibling components. I learned about controlled components and how we can convert uncontrolled components to controlled ones. A new concept was introduced here, which I have learned, and that is local storage. I store users' watched movies in local storage, and on refresh, the watched movies will still be there on a new load.
